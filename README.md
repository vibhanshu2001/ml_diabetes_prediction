# Diabetes Outcome Prediction
This project aims to predict diabetes outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is called 'diabetes.csv'. The columns are 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', and 'Outcome'. The 'Outcome' column is the target variable, which indicates whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries were used in this project:

pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
numpy: for numerical computation
sklearn.preprocessing: for data preprocessing
sklearn.model_selection: for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
sklearn.svm: for building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
sklearn.metrics: for evaluating the performance of the classifier
